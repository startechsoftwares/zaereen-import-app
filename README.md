Create seperate excel sheet and place the data in it, it should be in the below format.
ITS, Name, Mobile, Age, Location, Occupation, TripExp, Remarks. In case there are extra fields, then the code should be amended before executing.
it should start from the first column i.e.: A1
first row should be the column names and should match the above names.
2 arguments should be passed to the command line (use command prompt to execute the application, enter the path of the application and pass the 2 parameters).
i.e.: Excel Sheet (the one created above) path and the database (create a copy of production database on local) path
both the paths should have double quotes around them and both the paths should be separated by space.
Before attempting to run ensure the Account_No field in the production database is auto-generated, if not, then amend the code to generate account_no dynamically.
Run the application and it will insert the records in the database.
